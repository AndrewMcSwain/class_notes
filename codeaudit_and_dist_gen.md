# Prospecting Interesting Business-Service Activity

## Subjects of Interest:
The Following Subjects are of interest to us, currently:

+ Third-party code auditing
+ A decentralized, distributed, marketplace related to renewable energy installation and generation

With Third-Party Code auditing: 
+ a panorama of the risk vectors of contracting software development services
+ a decision-maker-centric framework of the domain in order to properly manage risk  
  + a rudimentary constraint model (surely better ones exist than I presented)
  + a rubric of cost performance, complexity management, and architectural excellence
  + a vision, strategy, and (rudimentary) incentives analysis for informally crowd-sourcing code auditors.

With the Distributed Renewable Energy Marketplace
Discussed: 
+ An in-depth (Game Theory-esque) risk/incentives analysis 
  + of potential strategies presented
  + of modifications or additional strategies and their merits
+ An in-depth (Game Theory-esque) risk/incentive analysis of additional strategies
 
##  Third-party code auditing:


the model below is a binary gradient with a single, two factor, modulator

```Proper Implementation --- ||isModulator|(EXPERTISE{x,y}|isMODULATOR|| --- cost/time [price tag]```
`Expertise x : Architectural`
`Expertise y:  Managerial` 

Notes:
+ Architectural has more impact on customer
+ Managerial may or may not have impact on price/quality positioning. Affects cootractor's profit moreso than client's price/quality. Mangerial practices have an impact on code quality that is harder for the client to quantify.

### Scenarios

During our class, we discussed two hypothetical scenarios. It is important to remember that these scenarios are stylized, to dilenate the extremes, which is useful for elucidating the underlying game-theoretic mechanics of the buyer/seller consumer/producer relationships of this particular domain.

In any IT project, price is the main pain-point. Mediocre software development is already difficult. Excellent software development requires a unique combination of genius, discipline, and experience that is extremely rare. Therefore, due to difficulty of the domain, and further difficulty to reach true excellence, Programmers are *the most* expensive pool of skilled labor in the world. 

The expensiveness of software development projects means that most out-sourced IT projects are negotiated on price and time. 

I argue that this is a mistake. It is my intent that the following description, though simplistic,  will reveal the reasoning behind this argument. 


### Scenario A

+Lower Price up-front

cost reduction incentives misaligned with proper implementation
realities of coding demand competent systems architects and realist cost/time projections or project will 
+ overrun costs
+ overrun deadlines
  + improper (lazy or rushed) systems architecture leads to bugs during development, which can slow development and reduce resourecs for the parts of the project to be implemented near the end of a project.
    +leads to drastically reduced price/quality ratio for buyer

It may end up costing the same amount or more as a HQ service with a higher initial price-tag.  
The project will also, most likely, be less extensible. (not future proof). most programmers who work in software development 'mills' bemoan the low quality code that they spit out and have to deal with from older projects built by other teams..

### Scenario B
+ higher price
+ long-term payoff
+ proper usability 
+ extensibility

+ even code quality (parts of the project done last are not of less quality than the first (when as a function of the resource overun mentioned above)
+ lower risk (but not guaranteeed) of budget deadline overrun and problems with implementation
+ properly navigating this field requires the oversight of a seasoned professional(s) with deep knowledge of software architecture as well as the capacity to understand the domain. (Third-Party Code Auditing comes in here)

### Price structure of contractor:
if he is HQ:
+ prices are high enough to reflect internal worst-case scenarios 
+ managerial acumen can reduce their costs, relative to conservative estimates based on worst-case scenarios, thereby improving profit
*try to find confirmation of early on*

### Strategy for informal crowdsourcing of code and sysarch experts

## Distributed Generation

### Transmission - 
Natural Monopoly -
<br>in a position to be market maker and underwriting coordinator for
<br>*Distributed Generation*

### Distributed Generation

### Problems: 
+ High Credit Risk reduces scalability
+ High Risk of spot price volatitlity creates material risk of negative margins. Reducing this risk requires reducing payout to consumer to a mere 3-5 years, which is hardly enough to reach payback on the technology, thereafter only inflation will be protected (so the risk of loss is passed on to the consumer) this *DRASTICALLY* increases default risk of consumers, even if they are solvent.
+ the market is not volumous enough to guaranteee price-efficient derviatives.
### Investor's inability to effectively predict or hedge spot price volatility for a period congruent with realistic consumer consumer incentives will create a tension between investor/consumer that is hard to mediate.

Possible Solution: market-place solutions are a proven method to allocate risk and reward such that incentives are maximized for involved counter-parties

### Benefit Analysis:

Investor Benfits:
Marketplaces mitigatge
Credit Risk
by:
+ Variety of Demographics
+ exceedingly greater liquidity

Markeplaces mitigate
General Risk of Loss
by:
+ Transparent, open, fair, standardized, trustworthy
+ makes derivatives easier to synthesize and manage
also good for: 

Price Volatility Risk

of which marketplace solutions provide:
+ liquidity
+ derivatives
+ ecology of financial functions (opportunity to act as underwriter with max timeline at fixed period)
+ multiple solutions for various risk profiles

### Consumer benefits:
Better (longer-term) incentive package
+ augments interest
++ which improves volume
+ removes disincentive for long-term adherence
+ which directly reduces risk of default

### Systemic drivers:
+ Increased consumption of New Tech
+ Improved financial sophistication of general population
+ improved coordination of  participation at vastly different ( human/organization scales)
+ Project management -> new tech buildout
++ New market cultivation techniques can be applied to other use cases
+++ Tesla GigaFactor Buildout 
+++ Project Penguin to industrially refreeze the north pole according to historical and geological record
+ True globalization through deeper and more dense interioantl relations
